> Actions are individual tasks that you can combine to create jobs and customize your workflow. You can create your own actions, and use and customize actions shared by the GitHub community.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software practice that necessitates frequently committing code to a shared repository. Upon committing code, it undergoes continuous building and testing to ensure that the commit doesn't introduce errors. Tests may include code linters, security checks, code coverage, functional tests, and custom checks. Building and testing code can be done locally or via a CI server.

GitHub offers CI workflow templates for various languages and frameworks. Explore the complete list of CI workflow templates offered by GitHub in the [actions/starter-workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/master/ci) repository.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment (CD) is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes visible to the software's users.

## Deploying Python Application on Heroku

- Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- Login to Heroku CLI session: `heroku login`
- Create new Heroku App: `heroku create`
- [Generate Authentication Token](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-quickstart#authentication): `heroku authorizations:create`
- 'Deploy to Heroku' Action:

```yml
- name: Deploy to Heroku
  env:
    HEROKU_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_TOKEN }}
    HEROKU_APP_NAME: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_APP_NAME }}
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' && job.status == 'success'
  run: |
    git remote add heroku https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_TOKEN@git.heroku.com/$HEROKU_APP_NAME.git
    git push heroku HEAD:master -f
