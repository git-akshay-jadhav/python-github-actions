    "CI/CD refers to the process in which your development team involves frequent code changes pushed in the main branch while ensuring that it does not impact any changes made by developers working parallelly. It provides smooth and convenient management.

We will be doing CI/CD with the help of GitHub actions. GitHub Actions make it easy to automate all your software workflows now with the help of CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. It uses YAML syntax to define the events, jobs, and steps. These files are stored in GitHub workflows, and a series of commands are automatically triggered whenever a code is pushed.
