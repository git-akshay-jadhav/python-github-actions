# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions

## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are crucial practices in modern software development workflows. CI/CD refers to the process of automating the building, testing, and deployment of code changes, ensuring that software is consistently developed, tested, and delivered in a rapid and reliable manner.

In this repository, we demonstrate how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate various tasks within the software development lifecycle directly from your GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with setting up CI/CD using GitHub Actions, ensure you have the following:

1. **Hardware Requirements**: A machine with at least 256 MB of RAM, although it's recommended to have more than 2 GB for smoother performance.

2. **GitHub Account**: You need to have a GitHub account and a project repository added to GitHub, which you want to keep track of using CI/CD.

3. **Project Information**: Have complete information about the frameworks and libraries used in your project, including their versions.

## Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Follow these steps to set up a CI/CD pipeline for your application:

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository containing your project to your local machine. If you haven't already, push your application code to the repository.

2. **Create Workflows**: Navigate to the Actions tab in your repository navbar and click on it. GitHub will automatically recommend workflows based on your code. Select the workflow that best fits your project, such as Node.js for a JavaScript project or Python for a Python project. Edit the YAML file to define the pipeline stages, such as build, test, and deploy.

3. **Install Runner**: If you haven't already configured a runner for GitHub Actions, follow the instructions provided in the repository settings to set up a runner. The runner is responsible for executing the workflow steps on your machine or a designated environment.

4. **Run Workflow**: Once the runner is configured, run the workflow by triggering it manually or automatically whenever a code change is pushed to the repository. Monitor the build progress in the Actions tab to ensure that the CI/CD process is running smoothly.

5. **Monitor and Troubleshoot**: Keep an eye on the build logs and any notifications from GitHub Actions. If there are any failures or errors during the build process, troubleshoot them accordingly to ensure that your CI/CD pipeline runs successfully.


## Conclusion

Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions enables you to automate repetitive tasks, streamline your development process, and deliver high-quality software faster. By leveraging the power of automation, you can focus more on writing code and less on manual deployment and testing processes.

This repository serves as a guide to help you get started with CI/CD using GitHub Actions. Feel free to customize the workflows and configurations based on your project requirements and preferences.
